# Day 1 - Zig

This is my first ever program written in Zig. At the time of writing this, Zig is at version 0.15.2. This amount of version changes before 1.0 means that every change is nearly breaking, meaning documentation, examples, and forums are constantly rendered out of date. The amount of pain I had to go through just to read a file is unparalleled. Not to mention this damn question. God I had thinking in circles and rotations, my feeble mind can't handle it.

It did not help that I didn't have the skills to setup a test matrix to help debug my pains away. I hope to never touch Zig again until it at least reaches 1.0. This language is pretty hardcore.

Nevertheless, the problem was actually not too trivial and required handling of annoying edge cases for the optimal solution.
