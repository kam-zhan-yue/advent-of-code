# Day 12 - Rust

My most beloved language. Shame that it didn't get much usage for this day as it was a meme question. Anyways, although I love the language and I have multiple projects in Rust, I keep having to search up how to do such simple things -_-

It's really one of those languages that you have to keep using regularly to keep your muscle memory sharp. But once you get back into the groove of it, it's just like riding a bike.
