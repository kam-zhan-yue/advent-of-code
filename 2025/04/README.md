# Day 4 - Bash

Technically not a language I am unfamiliar with, but definitely the first time I've used Bash to solve a traditional programming problem. It wasn't so bad even with the problem requiring usage of multidimensional arrays. Definitely possible with just managing one array, but I wanted to test out Bash's multidimensional array suppport and found usage with associative arrays.

This was fun as an experiment, but the runtime was laughable (200+ seconds on part two).
