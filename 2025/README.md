# Advent of Code 2025

This is my first official year participating in the Advent of Code in real time! As a joke, I harmlessly suggested to my colleagues that I should pick 12 languges and pick one at random each day. Unfortunately, this picked up some traction and I ended up going with it. However, it would be trivial to include all the languages I already know, as it would leave only a few days where I would need to learn something new.

As a challenge, I chose to include languages that I thought were interesting or had wanted to learn for a long time. It's the Advent of Code! What a perfect opportunity to expose myself to more languages. While it is definitely possible to pick up the basics of a language in one day, I had slightly miscalculated the difficulty of the languages I would choose...

| Day | Language | 
| - | - |
| 1 | [Zig*](01/README.md) |
| 2 | [Piet*](02/README.md) |
| 3 | [Elixir*](03/README.md) |
| 4 | [Bash*](04/README.md) |
| 5 | [C](05/README.md) |
| 6 | [Qaz++](06/README.md) |
| 7 | [Go*](07/README.md) |
| 8 | [C++](08/README.md) |
| 9 | [Python](09/README.md) |
| 10 | [TypeScript/Node](10/README.md) |
| 11 | [Lua](11/README.md) |
| 12 | [Rust](12/README.md) |

> * indicates either a language I had never learned before or an unusual one
