# Day 11 - Lua

I had to see what the hype was all about with this language, having only interacted with it briefly in Neovim configs. I can finally say that I've coded in Lua. However, it wasn't as cracked up as I thought it was going to be. Sure, it was easy to learn, and sure, the pattern matching and table data structure are handy, but I can't stop feeling as though it's all still inferior to Python in every single way. That is, if Lua wasn't so damn good at being embeddable. And it's probably faster than Python?

Either way, good day to test drive a new language with a top-down DP cache solution. No special tricks today.
