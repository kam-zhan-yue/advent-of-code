# Day 10 - Typescript / Node

Why Node? Well because this problem required a linear equation solver and Z3 wasn't supported in Bun or Deno :)

At least, at the time of writing this.

The amount of effort it takes to setup a simple Node JS project is stupid. And it's even stupider that the Node ecosystem is not _entirely_ consistent between JS runtiimes.

And this day's problem, oh my fucking god. I had not known the existence of solvers until I checked the solutions for this question. Not only did I make a nice, reusable BFS solution for Part 1, but it became unusable for Part 2.
