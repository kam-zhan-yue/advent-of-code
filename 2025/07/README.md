# Day 7 - Go

By this point, I'm pretty burned out with learning the fundamentals of a language in a short time frame and whipping up a solution based on rushed glimpses of documentation and Stack Overflow answers. Go had none of this. Learning it was a joy and it just built upon existing principles.

I just had to get used to the syntax and usage of slices, and I hit the ground running. It was at this time where I was getting used to a new keyboard too (shoutout Keyball44) but coding the entire solution only took a couple of hours. I guess it helped that it was a standard DP leetcode medium too that I'm used to grinding at this point.
